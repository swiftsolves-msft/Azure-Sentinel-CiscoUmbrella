name: DNS commonly abused TLDs
description: |
  'Some top level domains (TLDs) are more commonly associated with malware for a range of 
  reasons - including how easy domains on these TLDs are to obtain. Many of these may be undesirable 
  from an enterprise policy perspective. 
  The Domain_sCount column provides an initial insight into how widespread the domain usage is across the environment.'
