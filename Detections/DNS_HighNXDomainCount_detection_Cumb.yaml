Domain_s: Rare high NXDomain count
description: |
  'Identifies clients with a high NXDomain count which could be indicative of a DGA (cycling through possible C2 domains
  where most C2s are not live). Alert is generated when a new IP is seen (based on not being seen associated with 
  NXDomain records in prior 10-day baseline period).'
